`BEFORE EACH` 

PROs - 
- Useful to perform actions before every test
- Parallel run is possible, as before each will be done in all workers before a test starts

CONs - 
- But not very great to do same task for 100 times when running tests, Solution can be BEFORE ALL.


`BEFORE ALL`

PROs -
- Before All will need to run tests sequentially in single worker/ brower page.
- Not very bad, but it has to wait for one test to finish before starting next one.

CONs -  
- Solution is to use SIGNED IN ROLE.


`SIGNED IN STATE`

PROs - 
- Global-setup file is created and login details are stored GLOBALLY!!
    - Logged in State is saved in a JSON file when tests are triggered, Configs updated accordingly >>> storageState: 'loggedInState.json'
    - This means, all further ests can run in parallel using the details in loggedInState.json

CONs - 
- As loggedInState keeps all workers loggged in, we might need some workers to run test that does not need to be logged in already.
- Multiple Signed In Roles can be Solution


`MULTIPE SIGNED IN ROLES`

PROs - 
- Store multiple files - notLoggedInState and loggedInState as JSON files.
- Tests will have it mentioned if they need to use notLoggedInState
- Otherwise, they pick up the loggedInState
    - This means, we can run all tests in a single run in parallel using Playwright.

CONs - 
- Not anything obvious so far, we can log in future :) 


`PARALLEL TESTING`

PROs - 
- All tests should be independent and they can run in parallel in any worker.

CONs -

TIP - 
- >>>> npx playwright test tests --worker 4 >> Try restriting workers only if tests are flaky with too many workers.
- >>>> npx playwright test tests --worker 1 >> This will run tests in sequence, not in parallel due to number of workers
- Both above can be done in config file as well
- test.describe.serial() will also make tests run sequentially

`CROSS BROWSER TESTING`

PROs - 
- Trigger one test with 3 browsers in config, and they all run in parallel
- Can run in headless mode as well - chromium, FF, Webkit
- Can choose Mobile browsers as well
- We might not need Browser stack at all.

CONs - 
- Open to find out

TIP - 
- Edit config for any browser type needed


`REPORTERS` 

PROs - 
- Built in Reports available - List, Line, Dot, HTML, JSON REPORTERS
- Multiple reports can be obtained for tests, by config or via CLI
- Third Party Support - Allure, Tesults Reporter
- Attach Debug tracing into Allure reports 

CONs - 

TIP -
>>> npx playwright test blog.spec.ts --reporter=list 
>>> npx playwright test blog.spec.ts --reporter=line
>>> npx playwright test blog.spec.ts --reporter=html (Default)
>>> reporter: [['html'], ['list]] ==> Can also be specified in config

ALLURE - 

>> npm i -D @playwright/test allure-playwright  === > Install Allure
>> npm i -D allure-commandline   ===> Install CLI
>> npx allure generate allure-results --clean  ===> Generate Allure results into Allure report
>> trace.playwright.dev websbite will let you drop your trace from Allure report and analyse it
    - Make sure trace is set to trace: 'retain-on-failure', in configs.
